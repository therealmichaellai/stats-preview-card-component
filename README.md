## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS

### What I learned

This project was a sort of "back to basics" experience, relying solely on html and css without additional frameworks. I learned how to optimise viewing through the use of media queries.

```css
@media screen and (min-width: 1440px) {
  ...;
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to dive deeper into media queries and learn more about writing efficient and effective code.

### Useful resources

- [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) - Previous questions and answers in Stackoverflow helped me overcome the challanges I faced. For example, getting the color filter to display properly over the stock image took a bit of time.
